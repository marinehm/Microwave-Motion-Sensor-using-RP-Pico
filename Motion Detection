I just wanted to share this with others...
I created a motion sensor to turn on an overhead light in the shed used to store my motorcycle off the street,
with the least possible code. Totally HANDS-FREE! sleep(420) =7 minutes; was my fight against my personal OCD which most people would use 5, 10, 15, 20 etc minutes.

My next project will be to publish the status of the sensor to MQTT using a Pico W

from machine import Pin
from time import sleep

pir = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
led = Pin(22, Pin.OUT) #25=onboard led

def motion():
    if pir.value() ==1:
        led.on()
        sleep(420)
    else:
        led.off()

while True:
motion()`
