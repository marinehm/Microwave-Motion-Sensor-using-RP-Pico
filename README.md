I just wanted to share this with others...
I created a motion sensor to turn on an overhead light in the shed used to store my motorcycle off the street,
with the least possible code. Totally HANDS-FREE !  sleep(420) =7 minutes.

I played around with several different sensors including a PIR. The HW-MS03 V.06 worked BEST. It was responsive up to 10+ feet direct line of site. It worked through my plastic folding table and through a wall. it's not effected by changes to light or heat. The best sensitivity is from the flat sides; (front AND back), slightly less sensitive from the sides. It is not recommended to be installed in metal boxes. Not a problem; I have many professional-looking plastic boxes from SZOMK On AliExpress: Shop2007003 Store PART#s AK-S-01, AK-S-02, AK-S-03

My 1st of many to come projects; programming in Micropython on LOLIN D-1 Mini Pro(ESP8266), LOLIN ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico-W
